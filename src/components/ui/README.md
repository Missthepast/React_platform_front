# UI Components

This directory contains reusable, presentational UI components (dumb components).
These components should:

- Be purely presentational (no business logic).
- Be highly reusable.
- Accept data via props.
- Not rely on global state (Redux, Context, etc.) unless absolutely necessary for theming.

Examples:

- Button
- Input
- Card
- Modal (Base)
